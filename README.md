Overview

BeatAI is an AI-powered beat and song script generator designed for beginners with little to no experience in beat design or songwriting. Our goal is to make music creation more accessible, structured, and fun, especially at a time when social media has made creative hobbies more popular than ever.

Instead of replacing creativity with a one-click song generator, BeatAI focuses on guided creation. The system generates a structured song script and an intro-to-mid level beat that users can export as a MIDI file into tools like GarageBand. At the same time, it acts as a teaching tool, helping users understand what each part of the beat does and how it contributes to the overall song.

Problem & Motivation

Beginner music producers often struggle to turn ideas into finished beats. Many do not know how to structure a beat, lack music theory knowledge, or simply do not know where to start.

At the same time, social media platforms have created a huge opportunity for creative expression. People want to experiment with music, but the learning curve can feel overwhelming. AI tools now have the potential to streamline beat and song development while also helping beginners learn in an interactive way.

Our goal is to make learning and making music feel fun again.

Target Users

The primary users of BeatAI are individuals with little to no experience in:

> Beat design

> Song structure

> Scriptwriting for music

This includes teens, young adults, and anyone interested in creating beats or song scripts but unsure how to begin.

Core Tasks

BeatAI is designed to:

> Generate a solid song script based on user input (for example, a script about passion or achievement)

> Create an intro-to-mid level beat that can be exported as a MIDI file into GarageBand

> Allow users to interact with and modify certain beat features

> Deliver both a script and beat that reflect the user’s stated likes and dislikes

Success is defined by whether users feel the generated script and beat match their creative intent.

Existing Tools & Gaps

Current AI music tools fall into two main categories.

Black Box Generators

Examples include Suno AI and Udio. These tools generate high-quality audio instantly from a single text prompt. While impressive, they give users very little control over specific lyrics, chords, or structure. There is little educational value, and the experience can feel more like outsourcing creativity than learning it.

Text-Only Assistants

Examples include ChatGPT and Gemini. These tools are strong at rhyming, brainstorming themes, and structuring lyrics. However, they ignore the musical side of songwriting. Lyrics often do not match musical meter, and there is no guidance on chords, beat structure, or melody.

There is currently no system that meaningfully combines guided script generation with beat creation in a beginner-friendly and educational way.

Key Insights from Literature

> Our literature review highlights several important ideas:

> Unsupervised learning is effective for identifying musical patterns in messy, unstructured data.

> Neural networks can model emotional qualities in music, such as happy or sad tones.

> Systems like Aria-Duet demonstrate real-time human-AI collaboration in music production.

AI can take on different creative roles, such as generating harmonies that complement melodies.

These findings support the idea that AI can collaborate with humans in music production rather than fully replacing them.

Initial Concept & Value Proposition

The main goal of BeatAI is to enable first-time music users to create scripts and beats using AI in a simple and structured way.

We intentionally limit complexity. The system is designed to teach basic beat structure and explain how each component contributes to the song. Rather than overwhelming users with advanced controls, BeatAI focuses on foundational learning and guided experimentation.

The unique value of GenAI in this project is its teaching ability. Users can interact with an AI assistant that not only generates content but also explains what it is doing and why. This conversational learning model helps make music creation more approachable and engaging.

Milestones & Next Steps

For the next checkpoint, our goal is to build a partially working version of the model. We want to test:

> The script generation pipeline

> The beat generation pipeline

> The learning feature of the system

> Whether the model genuinely helps users understand beat structure

We also plan to begin evaluating whether users feel that the system is teaching them something meaningful.

Risks & Considerations

The biggest current risk is copyright. We need to ensure that generated beats and scripts are original and do not unintentionally replicate existing songs. This is especially important if users choose to publish content created with BeatAI on social media platforms.

We will explore safeguards to reduce this risk and ensure responsible AI usage.
