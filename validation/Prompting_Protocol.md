There are three AI Tools that we used, ChatGPT, Suno/Udio, Gemini

These are the prompts we gave each tool:

Prompt 1:

  Generate a 10 line beginner-friendly song plan about “sunsets and happy people.”
  
  Requirements:
  Use clearly labeled sections: Intro, Verse, Chorus, Verse 2, Bridge, Outro. Keep language simple and catchy.
  
  Provide:
  
  BPM (with explanation)
  
  Chord progression (at least 4 chords)
  
  Description of drum pattern
  
  Description of bassline role
  
  Keep everything intro-to-mid level complexity.
  
  Avoid advanced music theory terminology.

Prompt 2:

  Create a 10 line beat plan for a nostalgic but uplifting song at exactly 92 BPM.
  
  Constraints: Use only these instruments: kick, snare/clap, hi-hat, bass, simple melody.
  
  Provide an 8-bar chord progression (one chord per bar).
  
  Describe the drum pattern per bar.
  
  The chorus must contain exactly 8 lines, and each line must be 6–8 syllables.
  
  Keep explanations simple and beginner-friendly.
  
  Do not exceed these constraints.

Prompt 3:

  Based on your previous output:
  Keep the same BPM. Make the song feel more energetic without adding new instruments. Modify only the drum pattern and bassline. Explain exactly what changed and why.
  
  Then output:
  An 8-bar table showing:
   Bar | Chord | Kick Pattern | Snare Pattern | Hi-Hat Pattern

  Remember it should only be 10 lines
  
  Format the table clearly so it could be used to generate a MIDI file.
