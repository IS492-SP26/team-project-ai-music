What is the problem:
Existing AI tools for music creation fall into two extremes:

Black-box generators (Suno, Udio)
  These tools produce high-quality songs instantly but provide little transparency, customization, or educational value. Users cannot meaningfully control structure, chord progressions, or beat components.

Text-only assistants (ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot)
  These tools are strong at lyric generation and brainstorming but lack musical alignment. The outputs often ignore meter, chord structure, BPM, and do not provide exportable beat artifacts such as MIDI files.


There is currently no tool that combines:
  Structured songwriting
  Beginner-friendly beat creation
  Educational explanation
  Exportable musical artifacts
  Guided user control

Our AI Tool is supposed to have 3 main key features

1. A Structured Script
The tool must:

Generate clearly labeled sections (Intro, Verse, Chorus, Bridge, Outro)

Maintain logical narrative flow across sections

Keep language appropriate for beginner users

Allow topic-based customization

This addresses the failure of existing tools to consistently generate structurally coherent scripts aligned to beat progression.

2. The beats must align with the music

The tool must:

Generate a BPM based on the mood the user chooses

Produce a chord progression aligned to emotions in the song

Specify the drum, bass, and melody roles

Keep the complexity at an intro-to-mid level


This corrects the disconnect between lyrics and music seen in text-only assistants.

3. Educational Layer (“Learning Mode”)
The tool must:

Explain why the chords were chosen

Explain why the BPM fits the mood

Describe the role of each instrument within the song

Avoid talking about advanced music theory 

This differentiates BeatAI from black-box generators by making the creative process transparent.
