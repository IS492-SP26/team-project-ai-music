AI Song Contest: Human-AI Co-Creation in Songwriting. Proceedings of the 21st
International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR).
Huang et al. (2020) study how real teams collaborated with AI systems to write
complete songs. Instead of testing a single model, they observed 13 teams using
many different AI tools in a contest setting. One key insight is that musicians rarely
used end-to-end models. Instead of that, they broke songs into many smaller parts
such as lyrics, melody, harmony, and drums, then combined outputs manually. This
shows that current AI systems are not easily steerable. Many teams generated
hundreds or thousands of samples and curated them afterward. This added extra
work and slowed the creative process. The paper highlights an important tension: AI
increases creative possibilities but also introduces new technical burdens. The
authors argue that future systems must be more controllable, decomposable, and
context-aware across different environments. This directly supports the idea of
building a structured songwriting copilot instead of a one-click generator, because
users need guidance, iteration, and control to feel ownership.

Tchemeube et al. (2025) evaluate a co-creative AI music tool called MMM-C, which
is integrated into a professional music production software (Cubase). Unlike many
research systems, this tool was tested with expert composers. The study measured
usability, creativity support, and technology acceptance. Results showed that users
enjoyed the system and found it useful for exploration, but they struggled with
controllability. The interface only had one main parameter, temperature, which
limited precision. Participants often had to repeatedly generate outputs until they
found something usable. While the AI produced surprising and novel ideas, users
wanted more detailed control over structure and musical attributes. Importantly, most
composers still felt creative ownership of their work, meaning the AI acted more as a
collaborator than a replacement. This paper reinforces the idea that co-creative AI
systems must balance simplicity and control. Too little control reduces
expressiveness, but thoughtful interaction design can improve adoption and trust.
