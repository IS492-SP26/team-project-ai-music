Reflections on Co-Creative AI Research Papers

1. The Co-Creative Framework for Collaborative Artificial Intelligence

Citation: Kantosalo, A., & Toivonen, H. (2016). The Co-Creative Framework for Collaborative
Artificial Intelligence.

In this paper, Kantosalo and Toivonen explain what it means for AI to be co-creative.
They argue that AI should not fully replace humans in creative tasks.
Instead, AI should work together with people. The paper explains ideas like turn-taking,
shared initiative, and different roles the AI can play. Sometimes the AI can suggest ideas.
Other times, the human can guide the direction. The authors also explain that a good
co-creative system must allow the human to feel ownership of the final result.
What we found most important is the idea of balance. If the AI does too much, the human
feels less creative. If the AI does too little, it is not helpful. The system should support
creativity without taking control. This connects strongly to our songwriting copilot. We want
the AI to guide users step by step. The user should still make decisions about mood, lyrics,
and structure. This keeps creativity human-centered and meaningful.

2. Co-Creative Systems for Musical Interaction:

Citation: Frid, E., Ek, R., & Sundström, P. (2020). Co-Creative Systems for Musical Interaction:
A Survey.

This paper reviews many AI music systems that work with humans.
The authors study how AI and musicians interact during music creation.
Some systems generate full songs automatically. Other systems allow humans to edit parts
of the music while the AI provides suggestions. The paper compares these approaches and
discusses how interaction style affects creativity and user experience. One key idea from the
paper is that collaboration matters more than automation. When AI generates everything,
users may feel impressed but not involved. When AI allows users to change lyrics, melody, or
structure, people feel more connected to the music. The paper also shows that interactive
systems support learning and experimentation. This is important for our project because we
are building a guided songwriting tool, not a one-click generator.
We want users to revise sections, explore chord options, and understand how songs are
built. That makes the experience educational and creative at the same time.
