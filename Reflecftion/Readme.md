Liang, Qian, et al. “Mode-Conditioned Music Learning and Composition: A Spiking Neural Network Inspired by Neuroscience and Psychology.” ArXiv.org, 2024, arxiv.org/abs/2411.14773?utm_source=chatgpt.com. Accessed 12 Feb. 2026.

Summary: The article I have chosen titled, "Mode-Conditioned Music Learning and Composition: A Spiking Neural Network Inspired by Neuroscience and Psychology," talks about how they used a new type of neural network called a "spiking neural network" in order for the ML model to not only learn different types of beats, but also understand the feelings behind certain beats, and why certain beats are denoted as calming, happy, or sad. The model learns data similar to how our brains process information, and through this the model is able to provide better and more accurate musical recommendations to relate to human needs rather than simply creating random beats/noises.

3 Things I Learned:

Music isn’t black and white: Music has so many different complex elements to it, and by enabling the model to learn these complex notes, it allows it to make more accurate music recommendations and produce better-sounding beats.

Unlike a traditional neural network, a spiking neural network works differently by acting very similarly to how our brain receives and interprets information, whereas a regular neural network simply works through having multiple layers, and will often miss small but important details about information.

The Spiked Neural Network is biologically influenced, meaning it uses time signals to mimic how neurons are fired in the brain, and how we as humans process or comprehend information. This is done so the model can understand complex emotions such as sadness/happiness etc.

Limitations: Since the neural network is resembling a human brain, it is very hard to continuously train and fine-tune. As a result, actual real-world implementation and optimization will be really hard. Furthermore, it is also difficult to reflect the accuracy of the model, since emotions, especially musical emotions, are very subjective and vary from person to person.

Concrete Idea for the Project: The idea of having a neural network is really complicated; however, we can have a backend ML model to help train the system into recognizing certain simple emotions such as happiness and sadness. For example, high-pitched notes represent happiness and low notes represent sadness.

MLA Citation for Article 2:

Wang, Tianle, et al. “Discovering ‘Words’ in Music: Unsupervised Learning of Compositional Sparse Code for Symbolic Music.” ArXiv.org, 2025, arxiv.org/abs/2509.24603?utm_source=chatgpt.com. Accessed 12 Feb. 2026.

Summary: The second article I chose is titled, "‘Words’ in Music: Unsupervised Learning of Compositional Sparse Code for Symbolic Music." This article talks about how a group of researchers used unsupervised machine learning models to help understand and recognize patterns in music. Through this process, it will enable AI to help make more meaningful music that actually feels like music and not gibberish beats thrown together. It can also help detect things like plagiarism in music by being able to recognize pieces, and can help people lawfully own their music.

3 Things I Learned:

Unsupervised learning is better when it comes to trying to find patterns with unstructured data such as music.

Machine learning models can also allow for understanding music segments, which can help find out if people steal music segments.

Through this process, AI can learn from these models and truly make music segments that are meaningful.

2 Limitations:

The patterns in music segments that the model might find may not be meaningful, as since there are no labels, the data has to find patterns within itself.

The model needs to be trained on a LARGE amount of data, which is really hard to come up with, especially for MIDI files.

1 Concrete Idea: One concrete idea that we can implement is using an unsupervised model to learn simple music segments. This will help our model make more concrete music suggestions and suggestions the user actually likes.
