Summary: T‌he article I have choosen titled, " Mode-Conditioned Music Learning and Composition: A Spiking Neural Network Inspired by Neuroscience and Psychology. ", talks about how they used a new type of Nueral Ntework called a "spiking neural network" in order for ML model to not only learn different types of beats, but is also able to understand the feelings behind certain beats, and why certain beats are denoted as calming,happy or sad. The model learns data similar to how our brains process information, and through this the model is able to provide better and more accurate musical recommendations to relate to human needs rather than simply creating random beats/noises. 

3 Things I learned:

1. Music isnt black and white: Music has so many different complex elements to it, and by enabling the model to learn these complex notes, it allows it to make more accurate music recommendations and produce better sounding beats

2. Unlike a tradition Neural Network, a spiking enural network works differently by acting very similarly to how our brain recieves and interprets information, whereas a regular neural network, simply works through having multiple layers, and will often miss small but important details about information

3. The Spiked Nueral Network is biologically influenced meaning it uses time signals to mimic how neurons are fired in the brain, and how we as humans process or comprehend information. This is dont so the model can understand complex emotions such as sadness/happiness etc

Limitations:

Since the nueral network is resembling a human brain, it is very hard to continuously train and fine-tune, as a result actual real world implementation and optimization will be really hard. Furthermore it is also difficult to reflect the accuracy of the model, since emotions especially msusical emotions are very subjective and vary from person to person.

Concrete Idea for the project:

The idea of a having a neural network is really complicated however, we can have a backend ML model to help train the model into recognizing certain simple emotions such as happiness and sadness. For example high pitched notes represent happiness and low notes represent sadness
